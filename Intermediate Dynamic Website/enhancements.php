			<li> <strong> Blink </strong> <br />
			   It makes the text to blink. It's good for notification. In my case, <br />
               I have a sort of notification text as aside in the product page related <br />
			   to membership.The text will blink every 4 secs. By implementing blink, <br />
               I came to understand the @keyframes which is used for animation in CSS.<br />
			   It helps me to learn about animation in CSS. The blink was not covered in <br />
			   the lectures and also it's not the part of the assignment requirements. <br />
			   We need to implement two codes. First,we need to use blink selector where <br />
			   we define blink time, name and iteration period.second, @keyframes where <br />
			   we will use blink name and pass it to the code. We will set the opacity <br />
			   for text blinking. <br />
			   <a href="product.html#note"> Blink </a>
			
			</li>
			
			<li> <strong> Meter </strong>  <br />
			   The meter element is used to show the level of usage. I have used it<br />
			   in the aside element. There is no such requirement to use meter anywhere<br />
			   in the assignment. We need to use meter element where we will define the<br />
			   minimum and maximum limits. Also, the value of actual usage.<br />
			   <a href="product.html#card"> Meter </a>
